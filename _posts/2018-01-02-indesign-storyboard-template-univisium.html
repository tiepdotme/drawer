<p>This is a new Storyboards template for Adobe InDesign, on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page for <em>2:1 aspect ratio</em> (Univisium) Storyboards, with 5 frames per sheet. This layout draws inspiration from the beautiful Studio Ghibli layouts. You can either edit this Storyboards template with Adobe InDesign or print it out as it is to work on paper, the old school way (no cheating).</p>

<p><strong>Boxes:</strong></p>

<p>The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures for the same shot.</p>

<p>The second and main column stands for screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.</p>

<p>Then a space for your script notes: action, dialogue, etc.</p>

<p>The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.</p>

<p>To work from InDesign, duplicate the page you want to use. To import your drawings, place your pictures into the frames that belong to the <strong>Images</strong> layer. Reframe as you see fit. You can use the <strong>Rule of Thirds</strong> guides in locked layer to help you frame your compositions. Use the <strong>Text</strong> layer for your notes. Change the template to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credit and project details, add your production title or logo&hellip; And that’s it, your presentation is ready for print or screen.</p>

<p>IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2019.</p>

<p><strong>FYI:</strong> Since the document grid corresponds to the 2:1 aspect ratio, you can build variations with ease. The smallest module is 12 by 12 points. Its height matches the document body text’s leading—in case you’d like to type text. Use the <strong>Page-Master</strong> for pagination, the <strong>None</strong> for a clean sheet. Note that the layout is not centered to allow space for binding.</p>

<p>You can always hide the baseline grid for clarity.</p>

<p>You need the font Avenir installed on your machine for this template to work properly.</p>

<p>A free version of this template is available in PDF format here: <a href="https://gum.co/ghibli-Storyboards_en_2x1">https://gum.co/ghibli-Storyboards_en_2x1</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this template will save you time and help you design beautiful Storyboards.</p>
