This is a new storyboard template layout for films in 16:9 (1.77:1) aspect ratio that you can edit with [Apple Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/). If you use a Mac and need to design presentations, Pages is a useful productivity app you can download for free from the Apple App Store.

This template is ideal to design quick storyboard layouts.

This template comes with three master pages to format your layout. First, a cover page that you can use for introduction and credits. Then, a four frames + notes or notes + four frames pages. You can number your shots and write treatment notes alongside your pictures.

To get started, just change the text and drop your pictures into the placeholder frames. Fill the opening page with your project details. You can use the rule of thirds guides to help you reframe your shots. See **View** > **Guides** & **Hide** > **Guides**. To add a page, click on the (+ sign) **Add Page** above the left navigation panel. To change a given page's master, use the right navigation panel (under **Format**).

To change pagination, go to **Format**, then **Page Numbering**. To remove it, toggle off the **Footer**'s visibility. Add your own logo, paste your notes and so on. Your presentation will be ready to export for print or screen in no time.

FYI: The document size is a 21 x 30cm vertical sheet, about the size of a DIN A4 sheet. The body text font is Helvetica Regular,10 points with 1.2 line spacing. Youâ€™ll find different typographic styles in the Format panel.

Note that you need the Helvetica typeface license to use this template.

This template will help you put together your storyboards layouts in no time.
