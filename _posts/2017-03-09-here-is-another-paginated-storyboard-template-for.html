<img src="/images/picture_omkm7nl06H1s6ptp7o1_r1_1280.png"/><br/><p>Here is another paginated Storyboards template for Adobe InDesign (InDesign Markup / IDML format). The frame ratio is 1.33:1 (4:3), a traditional television &amp; computer monitor standard.</p>

<p>The sheet is a Din A4 horizontal (portrait), is ready to use for print and screen presentations. This template lets you write your notes alongside your pictures; simply edit the <em>Copy</em> and <em>Images</em> layers in InDesign. The text is set in Helvetica Regular, 10pt. For images, just drop your boards in the black(or white) <em>Images</em> layer. Toggle on and off the rule of thirds guides in the locked layers to help you frame your compositions.</p>

<p>Fill in the title page, replace the logo and credentials. To edit the footer at once, use the A &amp; C masters.</p>
