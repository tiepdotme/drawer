This is a free storyboard template in PDF format on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, designed for print. This template has 5 frames per sheet each in 2:1 aspect ratio (Univisium). The layout is inspired by the beautiful storyboards from Studio Ghibli.

The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shotsâ€”you can have several pictures for the same shot.

The second and main column stands for the pictures screen. It is where you draw or place your storyboard frames.

Then there is a space for your script notes: action, dialogue, etc.

The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.

Print it out and start drawing on paper right away.
