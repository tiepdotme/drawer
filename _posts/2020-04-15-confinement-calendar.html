<p>SARS-COV-2, also know as the novel coronavirus that leads to COVID-19 illness is no joke. Quarantine proved its ability to relieve our healthcare system of some of the pressure it induces. Self-imposed confinement works, as long as everybody participates.

This calendar is a symbolic way to convey the idea that each day we spend in confinement makes the virus less damaging.</p>

<p>I drew this for my 10 year old daughter and her classmates. Besides adding a little fun to these strange times, it lets you visualize your time spent in confinement. Kids like to put a face on a situation that may not look so bad even though it may frighten their parents.</p>

<p>If you and your kids are counting the days until you can go outside again freely, this calendar is for you. The virus gets weaker as you cross out/color/tear up each day.</p>

<p><em>Stay home until the virus is gone.</em></p>


<p>You can get the printable <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/haubj9qf1ecuf77/AADFrx_6Q1WRS2KFp9Cq7UmVa?dl=0">lockdown calendar(s) in PDF format</a> here.
