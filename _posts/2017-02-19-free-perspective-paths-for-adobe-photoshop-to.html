<p>This will open as a blank file so make sure you are in Paths, not Layers. Move the perspective points in group or one by one with the Direct Selection Tool. Stroke the paths once you are happy with your settings. Use it in combination with Photoshop&rsquo;s Vanishing Point filter to draw complex perspectives.</p>
