This is an anime storyboard template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page for 2.39:1 (scope) aspect ratio storyboards, with seven frames per sheet. This layout draws inspiration from the superb *Studio Ghibli* layouts. You can either edit this storyboard template with Adobe InDesign or print the blank double page to draw on paper.

**Boxes:**

- The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures per shot.
- The second column stands for the picture screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.
- Then there is a space for your script notes for action, dialogue, etc.
- The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.

Only duplicate the pages you want to use. To import your drawings, place your pictures into the frames that belong to the **Images** layer. You can use the ***Rule of Thirds*** guides located in the top locked layer to help you frame your compositions. For notes, use the **Text** layer. Change the template to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credits and project details, put your production title or logo. And your presentation is now ready for print or screens in no time!

IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to the current InDesign CC 2020.

**FYI:** Since the document grid corresponds to the 2.39:1 aspect ratio, you can build variations with ease. The smallest module is 29,751 by 12,448 points, its height matches the document body text’s leading. You will find 9 or 10 points for body text in the **Paragraph Styles** tab. You need the font Avenir installed on your machine to use this template to the fullest. Use the **A-Pagination** master to create a paginated layout or the **A-Master** for a presentation without pagination.

You can always hide the baseline grid and the document grid for clarity (**View** > **Grids & Guides** > **Show Baseline Grid** & **Hide Baseline Grid**).

I hope this template will save you time and help you design beautiful storyboards!
