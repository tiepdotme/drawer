This is a modular storyboard template layout that you can edit with Adobe InDesign. IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesgin versions from CS4 to InDesign CC 2019.

This template has 15 DIN A4 vertical (portrait) pages ready to use.

All you have to do is change the **Text** and **Images** layers in InDesign to make it your own. Fill in the title page, add your credit and project details, replace the logo with yours.

Write your treatment notes alongside your pictures in the **Text** layer.The text is set in the classic screenplay form type, Courier 10 points with 12,376 points leading. For images, drop your pictures in the **Images** layer. You can show or hide the rule of thirds layer guides in locked layers to help you frame your compositions.

Duplicate the spreads or page you want to use. Remove unnecessary sheets. The default pagination is located in the **A-Pagination master**. Once you are happy with your layout, export your presentation for print or screen.

The document grid corresponds to the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Pictures should align to the baseline grid. The document grid modules themselves abide to the 1.85:1 ratio exactly as they should. Which means you can build any variation on top of the initial template’s grid with ease! Now that’s cool. The smallest module is 22,895 by 12,376 points, its height matching the document body text’s leading.

You can always hide the baseline grid and/or the document grid for clarity. (**View** > **Grids & Guides** > **Show Baseline Grid** & **Hide Baseline Grid**). You need the Courier font installed on your machine to use this template.

Tip: You can print the last three pages of the template when you need to draw storyboards in clean frames on paper.

The template comes with a few vector arrows to indicate camera moves. You can get more icons for free here: [https://gum.co/storyboard-arrows](https://gum.co/storyboard-arrows).

This template will save you time and help you present beautiful storyboards.
