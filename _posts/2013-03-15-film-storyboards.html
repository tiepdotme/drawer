<br/><hr><p>Storyboarding is a unique yet simple way to see the whole picture of a project at once.
  You can use a Storyboards as a visual screenplay, at the writing stage of a film.
  You can use it to edit before filming: test how a story works in images, organize its sequences rhythm and flow.
  Storyboards are useful to plan, assess costs and ease communication between production crew members.</p>

<p>This blog is all about storyboards, obviously but also work in process, sketches, doodles and pre-production drawings as well as the occasional filmmaking references and links.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
