IDML (InDesign Markup) is compatible with all Adobe InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2019.</p>

<p>This template is ideal for film treatments and Storyboards layouts.</p>

<p>This template has over 50 DIN A4 vertical (portrait) numbered pages. It gives you many layout variations and framing options. You can choose whether you want three, five or ten frames per page. Pick a white or black background with a frame surrounding the pages or nor by changing master. You can number your shots and write treatment notes alongside your pictures. Some of the designs have space to draw outside the frame.</p>

<p>To get started, only duplicate the spreads or page you want to use. Remove unused sheets. Then all you have to do is change the <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Images</strong> layers. Fill the opening page with your project details. The body text font is Avenir Light,10 points with 12,448 points leading. Drop your pictures into the <strong>Images</strong> layer. Show or hide the  Rule of Third guides to help you reframe your compositions. You will find these guides in the top locked layer.
To change or remove pagination, use any specific master that applies to your layout. Add a logo, complete the credits page and so on. Your presentation is then ready to export for print or screen.</p>

<p><strong>FYI:</strong> The document grid corresponds to the 2.39:1 aspect ratio (2.39:1). Pictures should align with the baseline grid. The document grid modules themselves abide by the 2.39:1 ratio exactly as they should. That means you can build any variation on top of the initial template’s grid with ease. Now, that is cool. Suppose you want frames in four rows instead of five. You can adjust all your document proportions by following the grid. The smallest module is 29,751 by 12,448 points, its height matches the document body text’s leading.</p>

<p>Note that you need the Avenir typeface license to use this template.</p>

<p>This template will help you save time and design beautiful presentations.</p>
