<img src="/images/picture_p0wg75pdW21s6ptp7o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is a free Storyboards template in PDF format on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, designed for print. This template has 5 frames per sheet each in 2:1 aspect ratio (Univisium). The layout is inspired by the beautiful Storyboards from Studio Ghibli.</p>

<p>The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shotsâ€”you can have several pictures for the same shot.</p>

<p>The second and main column stands for the pictures screen. It is where you draw or place your Storyboards frames.</p>

<p>Then there is a space for your script notes: action, dialogue, etc.</p>

<p>The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.</p>

<p>Print it out and start drawing on paper right away.</p>
