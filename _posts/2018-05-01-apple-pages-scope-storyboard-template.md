This is a Storyboards template layout for 2.39:1 films that you can edit with [Apple Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/).

This template is ideal to design quick Storyboards layouts.

This template comes with three master pages to format your layout. First, a cover page that you can use for introduction and credits. Then, a five frames + notes or notes + five frames pages. You can number your shots and write treatment notes alongside your pictures.

To get started, just change the text and drop your pictures into the placeholder frames. Fill the opening page with your project details. Drop your pictures into the **Images** layer. You can use the *rule of thirds* guides to help you reframe your shots. See **View** & **Guides** > **Hide** > **Guides** To add a page, click on the (**+** sign) **Add Page** above the left navigation panel. To change a given page's master, use the right navigation panel (under **Format**).


To change pagination, go to **Format**, then **Page Numbering**. To remove it, toggle off the **Footer**'s visibility. Add a logo, notes and so on. Your presentation will be ready to export for print or screen in no time.

FYI: The document size is a 21 x 30cm vertical sheet, about the size of a DIN A4 sheet. The body text font is Avenir Light,10 points with single line spacing. Youâ€™ll find different typographic styles in the Format panel.

Note that you need the Avenir typeface license to use this template.
