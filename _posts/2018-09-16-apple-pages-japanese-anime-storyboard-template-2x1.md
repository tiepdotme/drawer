This is a new Apple Pages anime storyboard template for DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page ready to use. You can edit the .template file in [Apple Pages](). Designed for anime storyboards, with 5 frames per sheet, each frame sets an exact 2.00:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen) space for pictures. The layout draws inspiration from the excellent Studio Ghibli storyboards.

**Boxes:**

- The first column, **カット** indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.
- The second and main column is **画面** which stands for the picture screen. That’s where you draw or place your storyboard shots.
- **内容** stands for content, use this space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)
- The last column, **秒** is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.

To get started, just change the text and drop your pictures into the *placeholder frames*. To add a page, click on the (+ sign) **Add Page** above the left navigation panel. To change a given page's master, use the right navigation panel (under **Format**).

To change pagination, go to **Format**, then **Page Numbering**. Change the template to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credit and project details, add your production title or your logo. Your layout will be ready to export for print or screen in no time.

FYI: The document size is a 21 x 30cm vertical sheet, about the size of a DIN A4 sheet. The body text font is Avenir Light,10 points with single line spacing. You’ll find different typographic styles in the Format panel.

Note that you need the Avenir typeface license to use this template.
