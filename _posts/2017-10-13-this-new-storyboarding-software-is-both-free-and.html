<a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tools/new-storyboarding-software-free-open-source-153927.html">This New Storyboarding Software Is Both Free And Open Source</a><br/><p>You can download the <a href="https://wonderunit.com/Storyboardser/">Storyboarder app on Wonderunit site</a>.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/wonderunit/Storyboardser"><em>Storyboarder</em>&rsquo;s GitHub repo link</a> if you feel like contributing.</p>

<p>And yes, it is an <em>opinionated</em> software. For instance the absence of layers is frowned upon by some. On the other hand this is a tool designed for the author&rsquo;s purpose: visualising and blocking scenes fast within a certain type of constraints. The unique layer constraint is exactly what makes this app a good tool for drawing fast. You don&rsquo;t get to draw in layers when you are Storyboarding on paper either.</p>
