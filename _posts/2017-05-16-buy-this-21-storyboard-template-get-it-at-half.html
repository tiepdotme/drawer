<p>Here is a new Storyboards template for Adobe InDesign (InDesign Markup / IDML format). The frame ratio is 2:1 (18:9), which is cinematographer Vittorio Storaro&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univisium">Univisium</a> film format. The number of feature films using this format is growing. Immersive 360° films such as virtual reality videos also use an <a href="http://stateofvr.com/?page_id=16864">equirectangular</a> image format with a 2:1 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>This 22 pages layout for ANSI A Letter horizontal (landscape)  is ready to use for print and screen presentations. This template lets you write your screenplay or treatment notes alongside your pictures and number them. Simply edit the <em>Text</em> and <em>Images</em> layers in InDesign. The text is set in Avenir Light in 10pt. For images, just drop your pictures in the <em>Images</em> layer. Pictures should align with the square grid—each subdivision is 12 points square to match the leading. You can toggle on and off the rule of third guides in the locked layer to help you frame your compositions.</p>

<p>Fill in the title page, replace the logo and credentials. To edit the footer at once, use the A-Master for white background pages or the B-master for black background.</p>

<p>ANSI A Letter (North American paper size) is 11.0 by 8.5 inches. If you need the equivalent template for ISO, it is <a href="https://gum.co/2x1may">available in A4 size</a>.</p>
