This is a free anime storyboard template in PDF format on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, designed for print. This template has 5 frames per sheet each in 2:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen). The layout is inspired by the beautiful storyboards from Studio Ghibli.

**Boxes:**

- The first column, **カット** indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.
- The second and main column is**画面** which stands for the picture screen. That’s where you draw or place your storyboard shots.
- **内容** stands for content, use this space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)
- The last column, **秒** is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.


Print it out and start drawing on paper, that's the real deal.
