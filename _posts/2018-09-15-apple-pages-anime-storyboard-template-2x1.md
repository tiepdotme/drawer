This is an anime storyboard template for DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page ready to use. You can edit this .template file in Apple Pages. Designed for anime storyboards, with 5 frames per sheet, each frame sets an exact 2.00:1 (Univisium) aspect ratio space for pictures. The layout draws some inspiration from the excellent Studio Ghibli storyboards.

**Boxes:**

- The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures for the same shot.
- The second and main column stands for the picture screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.
- Then there is a space for your script notes for action, dialogue or sound.
- The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.

To get started, just change the text and drop your pictures into the placeholder frames. To add a page, click on the (+ sign) **Add Page** above the left navigation panel. To change a given page's master, use the right navigation panel (under **Format**).

To change pagination, go to **Format**, then **Page Numbering**. Change the template to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credit and project details, add your production title or your logo. Your layout will be ready to export for print or screen in no time.

FYI: The document size is 21 x 30cm vertical sheet, about the size of a DIN A4 sheet. The body text font is Avenir Light, 9 points with single line spacing. You’ll find different typographic styles in the Format panel.

Note that you need the Avenir typeface license to use this template.
