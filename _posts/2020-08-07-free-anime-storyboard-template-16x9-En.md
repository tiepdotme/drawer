This is a free anime storyboard template in PDF format on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, designed for print. This template comes in two PDF with 5 frames per sheet each in 16:9 (1:77:1) aspect ratio. One has a custom storyboard logo, the other lets you write your production details. The layout is inspired by the beautiful storyboards from Studio Ghibli.

**Boxes:**

- The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures for the same shot.
- The second and main column stands for the picture screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.
- Then there is a space for your script notes for action, dialogue, etc.
- The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.


Print it out and start drawing on paper, that's the way to do it!
