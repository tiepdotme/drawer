<img src="/images/storyboarder_test.jpg"/><br/><br/><p>Storyboard test done with <a href="https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/" class="picture_blog">Storyboarder</a>, by <a href="https://wonderunit.com/" class="picture_blog">Wonder Unit</a>. Storyboarder is an app designed with constraints that are optimized for storyboarding. It focuses on the essentials, drawing shots. With just a few tools, its interface is toy-like and very intuitive. The drawing feel is good. Among other things you get a quick and PDF layout export. It also has a simple timeline so you can use it to build basic animatics</p>
<p>Definitely recommended for storyboards.</p>
