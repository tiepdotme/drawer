This is a modular storyboard template layout that you can edit with Adobe InDesign. IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2020.

This storyboard template has 28 DIN A4 vertical (portrait) pages ready to use. All you have to do is change the **Text** and **Images** layers in InDesign to make it your own. Fill in the title page, add your credits, project details, and your logo. Write your treatment notes alongside your pictures. Then your presentation is ready! The body text uses the classic screenplay form type Courier 10 points with 12,376 points leading. For images, drop your pictures in the Images layer. You can show or hide the ***rule of thirds*** layer guides located in the top locked layer to help you frame your compositions.

Duplicate the spreads or pages you want to use. Remove unnecessary sheets. You can change the default pagination in the **A-Pagination** master. Once you are happy with your layout, export your presentation for print or screen.

Pictures should align to the baseline grid. The document grid modules themselves abide by the 1.77:1 ratio exactly as they should. That means you can build any variation on top of the initial template’s grid with ease. Now, that’s cool! The smallest module is *21,333* by *12* points. Its height matches the document body text’s leading.

You need the Courier font installed on your machine to use this template.

This template will help you present your storyboards quickly.
