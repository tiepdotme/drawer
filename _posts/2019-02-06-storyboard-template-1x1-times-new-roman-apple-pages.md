New storyboard template layout for films in 1:1 aspect ratio, ideal for video and photography on social media with three frames per sheet. You can edit this template with [Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/), the free Apple productivity app.

With three master pages to format your layout, this template is perfect to design quick storyboard layouts.

The first page is a cover page with a full size image placeholder, to introduce your project and credits. The second page has square frames facing copy. The third comes with notes column first, facing three square frames. It makes it easy to number your shots and write a treatment alongside your pictures.

To get started, just change the text and drop your pictures into the placeholder frames. Fill the opening page with your project details. To add a page, click on the (**+** sign) **Add Page** above the left navigation panel. To change a given page's master, use the right navigation panel (under **Format**).

To change pagination, go to **Format**, then **Page Numbering**. To remove it, toggle off the **Footer**'s visibility. Add your own logo, paste your script and so on. Your presentation will be ready to export for print or screen in no time.

FYI: The document size is a 21 x 30cm vertical sheet, about the size of a DIN A4 sheet. The body text font is in Times New Roman, 12 points with 1.2 line spacing. You’ll find different typographic styles in the **Format** panel.

Note that you need the Times New Roman license to use this template—on Mac it should be a system font.

This template will help you create nice storyboards layouts and save up pre production time.
