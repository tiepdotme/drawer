This is a WIP illustration for *Supply*, an e-commerce theme with Gumroad integration built with Jekyll and Tachyons.


✅ Supply documentation microsite: [https://supply.templates.supply/](https://supply.templates.supply/)

✅ Supply’s repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/YJPL/Supply](https://github.com/YJPL/Supply) (MIT license)

✅ About page to get started: [https://supply.templates.supply/about/](https://supply.templates.supply/about/)

✅ Tutorial pages & how-to: [https://supply.templates.supply/tutorial/](https://supply.templates.supply/tutorial/)

This theme lets any Gumroad creator showcase their products on their static site. Or it can serve as a basis to create product pages for people who already use Jekyll.
The documentation is quite complete by now, although far from perfect. I am committed to maintain and improve it along the way.
