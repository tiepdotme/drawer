<p>Sketching is the corner stone of creation, be it painting, Illustration, design…
I’m pretty sure countless works of art sparked from a tiny scribble in a Sketchbooks, somewhere.
This include films and animation works but it doesn’t stop with the visual arts.
Even some unillustrated books and literary works started with Sketches.
And it applies to a lot of other fields too: webdesign, architecture, planning, etc.
In a sense drawing is akin to writing.
Taking notes helps us to order our thoughts but we can also use it to trigger ideas.</p>

<p>Have you heard of automatic writing?
Maybe something similar, although not in the literal sense, is at play when we are drawing Sketches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a Sketchbooks everywhere” is great advice and I sure have one with me everywhere I go.
Actually, I <a href="https://silentcomics.com/drawing/The-Draughtsman-Sketchbook-Creed/">repurposed the <em>US Army Rifleman’s Creed</em></a>, to say the same thing.</p>
