This is a paginated [Apple Keynote](https://www.apple.com//keynote/) theme for film storyboards, in 1.85:1 (widescreen) aspect ratio. With 25 master slides, this theme is ready for print or screen use. There are title pages, intro pages, treatment pages, a text + three frames master, a three frames, notes + set plan + 3 frames, 6 frames numbered, single frame pages and an icon master.

To create your storyboard, first, add a new slide—in the left area navigator (**Add Slide**).

You can change your slide layout (**Format** > **Change Master** button) in the right navigation panel (**View** > **Inspector** > **Format**).

Then chose your layout in the left navigator. Whether you use text or not, page, scenes and shot numbers. You can use the rule of thirds guides to help you reframe your shots (**View** > **Guides** & **Hide Guides**). To make consistent changes to your layout, use the **Edit Master Slide** button in the right navigation panel.

There are also arrows located in the last master slide. Copy and paste icons from the Master Slide into your document. Use them to show camera moves, movement within the shot and the character’s looks.

This template is in English, the body text is set in Avenir Light 10 points with 1.2 spacing. You’ll find different typographic styles for your text in the **Format** panel.

This theme makes it easy and fast to put your film treatment and storyboard together in a clean presentation.
