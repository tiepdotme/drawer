<img src="/images/picture_osdj2s576t1s6ptp7o1_r1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is a modular Storyboards template that you can edit with Adobe InDesign. IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesin versions from the late CS4 up to Creative Cloud versions.</p>

<p>This Storyboards template has 48 Din A4 horizontal (landscape) numbered pages. This Storyboards template lets you write your treatment notes alongside your pictures. All you have to do is change the <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Images</strong> layers in InDesign to make it your own. Fill in the title page, add your credit and project details, replace the logo with yours. Then your presentations are ready for print or screen. The text is set in the classic screenplay form type, Courier 10 points with 12,3 points leading. For images, drop your pictures in the <strong>Images</strong> layer. You can show or hide the <em>rule of thirds</em> layer guides in locked layers to help you frame your compositions. </p>

<p>Duplicate the spreads or page you want to use. Remove unnecessary sheets. To edit the footer at once, use the Masters (black or white background). </p>

<p>The document grid corresponds to the <em><strong>1.85:1</strong></em> aspect ratio. Pictures should align to the baseline grid. The document grid modules themselves abide to the 1.85:1 ratio exactly as they should. Which means you can build any variation on top of the initial template’s grid with ease! Now that’s cool. The smallest module is <em>22,755</em> by <em>12,3</em> points, its height matches the document body text’s leading.</p>

<p>You can always hide the baseline grid and/or the document grid for clarity. (<strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Grids &amp; Guides</strong> &gt; <strong>Show Baseline Grid</strong> &amp; <strong>Hide Baseline Grid</strong>). You need the Courier font installed on your machine to use this template. You can print the last three pages of the template when you need to draw Storyboards in clean frames on paper.</p>

<p>This template will save you a lot of time and help you put together beautiful layouts!</p>
