<img src="/images/picture_otjl3s4HQ41s6ptp7o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is an <strong>anime Storyboards template</strong> on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page that you can edit in Adobe InDesign. Designed for 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen) Storyboards, with 5 frames per sheet. The layout is drawing inspiration from the fantastic Studio Ghibli Storyboards. You can either edit the layout with Adobe InDesign or print it out as it is to work on paper, the old school way (no cheating).</p>

<p><strong>Boxes:</strong></p>

<p>The first column, カット indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.</p>

<p>The second and main column is 画面 which stands for screen. That’s where you draw or place your images.</p>

<p>内容 stands for content, use this space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)</p>

<p>The last column, 秒 is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.</p>

<p>To work from InDesign, duplicate the page you want to use. To import your drawings, place your pictures into the frames that belong to the Images layer. Resize as you see fit. If you want, you can use the Rule of Third guides in locked layer to help you frame your compositions. Change the template as you see fit to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credit and project details, add your production title or logo&hellip; And that’s it, your presentation is ready for print or screen.</p>

<p>IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to CC.</p>

<p><strong>FYI:</strong> Since the document grid corresponds to the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, you can build variations with ease. The smallest module is 22,895 by 12,376 points. Its height matches the document body text’s leading—in case you’d like to type text. Use the Page-Master for pagination.</p>

<p>You can always hide the baseline grid and/or the document grid for clarity. (View &gt; Grids &amp; Guides &gt; Show Baseline Grid &amp; Hide Baseline Grid.) You may need the font Avenir installed on your machine to work with text, but you can use another font.</p>
