<img src="/images/Storyboard_WordPress_theme_screenshot.png"/><br/><p><em>Storyboard</em> is a lean portfolio WordPress theme. This theme draws an inspiration from screenplay form. It tends toward a classic look, with an emphasis on clarity. Its galleries can work well for illustrators and photographers who focus on images. But also for programmers who like to write a simple blog in monotype font.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>

<hr><ol><li><p>Upload and install <code>Storyboard</code> in your WordPress dashboard under Appearance -&gt; Themes.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a category <code>portfolio</code>. Only label the posts you want to display on the home page under this ‘portfolio’ category.</p></li>
<li><p>Chose how to display the home page: Home 2 columns, Home 3 columns, or Home 4 columns</p></li>
</ol><p>By default the home page will display the first image for each post, assuming post(s) exist in the category &lsquo;portfolio&rsquo;. Use feature image in your post to display an image of your choosing. For a post without image a blue placeholder image will appear, so you should also use featured image, even if your content post is only text.</p>

<p><strong>Customize this theme</strong></p>

<hr><p>The theme is provided with Sass files so you can easily make it your own.</p>

<p>Fonts are embedded into the theme so it doesn&rsquo;t rely on a third party to load fonts.</p>

<p>You can use a custom SVG logo, an image logo or the default title and description. But not all three simultaneously.</p>

<p>If you want to use your own SVG logo, you will need to uncomment (remove the double slash) line 36 in the header.php file. (Right before <code>get_template_part( '/assets/inline', 'logo.svg' );</code> )</p>

<p>Add your own SVG logo in BASE64 code into the inline-logo.svg.php file provided here as an example.</p>

<p>You can use a free online service to translate your SVG logo into BASE64 code, and paste it to replace the sample in inline-logo.svg.php. Your SVG logo will then appear in the left-hand corner of your site.</p>

<p>You can also add a custom image logo from the customizer. Go to site identity → logo, or use the site text title + description.</p>
