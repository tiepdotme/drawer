<blockquote>
<p>This is a Storyboards template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page. For 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen) Storyboards, with 5 frames per sheet. The layout draws inspiration from the beautiful Storyboards from Studio Ghibli. You can either edit the layout with Adobe InDesign or print it out as it is to work on paper, the old school way (no cheating).</p>

<p><strong>Boxes:</strong></p>

<p>The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures for the same shot.
The second and main column stands for screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.
Then a space for your script notes: action, dialogue, etc.
The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.</p>

<p>To work from InDesign, duplicate the page you want to use. To import your drawings, place your pictures into the frames that belong to the Images layer. Resize as you see fit. If you want, you can use the Rule of Third guides in locked layer to help you frame your compositions. Change the template as you see fit to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credit and project details, add your production title or logo… And that’s it, your presentation is ready for print or screen.</p>

<p>IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2019.</p>

<p><strong>FYI:</strong> Since the document grid corresponds to the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, you can build variations with ease. The smallest module is 22,895 by 12,376 points. Its height matches the document body text’s leading—in case you’d like to type text. Use the <strong>Page-Master</strong> for pagination, the <strong>A-Master</strong> for a clean sheet.</p>

<p>You can always hide the baseline grid and/or the document grid for clarity. (<strong>View &gt; Grids &amp; Guides &gt; Show Baseline Grid &amp; Hide Baseline Grid.</strong>) You may need the font Avenir installed on your machine to work with text, but you can use another font.</p>
