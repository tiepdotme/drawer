<br/><br/><p><strong>Update:</strong> The <a href="https://gum.co/univisium-keynote">2:1 Storyboards theme for Apple Keynote</a> was updated.</p>

<p>The 2:1 (18:9) aspect ratio, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univisium">Univisium</a> was initiated by cinematographer Vittorio Santaro. More and more films use this format. For instance, immersive 360Â° films such as virtual reality videos are framed in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">equirectangular</a> image format with a 2:1 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s available now in the <a href="https://gumroad.com/Storyboards">Storyboards Shop</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to layout, Adobe InDesign is great but when it comes to speed, Apple Keynote is even faster. It&rsquo;s simplicity (once you get used to it) is also very convenient.</p>

<p>This theme has now 6 master slides instead of 3, in a clean layout on A4 horizontal, ready for print or screen use.</p>

<p>All you have to do is adding your script alongside your pictures and set your frames and scenes numbers.</p>

<p>If you use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8">Keynote</a> in your workflow, this theme will come in handy.</p>
