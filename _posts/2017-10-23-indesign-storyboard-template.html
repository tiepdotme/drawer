<img src="/images/picture_oya3rlDrof1s6ptp7o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is a Storyboards template layout for films set in 16:9 (1.77:1) frame ratio, editable with Adobe InDesign. This template has 3 frames per sheet with boxes for set plan. This is useful if you have complex scenes where you want to show where the camera is.</p>

<p>This template consists of 6 DIN A4 vertical (portrait) numbered pages. A cover page, 2 double pages for Storyboards, an ending page for credits. Pagination will appear on the top right of each page. You can number your scenes, as well as your shots or cuts. To get going, all you have to do is change the <strong><em>Text</em></strong> and <strong><em>Images</em></strong> layers in InDesign to make it your own. Fill in the title page, add your credit and project details, add a logo, and so on. Your presentation is then ready for export to print or screen. The text is set in the classic screenplay form type, Courier 10 points with 12,027 points leading. For images, drop your pictures in the Images layer. You can toggle the <strong><em>Rule of thirds layer</em></strong> guides to help you frame your compositions. See the top layer in Layers window.
Duplicate the spreads or page you want to use. Remove unnecessary sheets. To change or remove pagination, remove the <strong><em>A-Master</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The main pictures frames align to the image lines. You can always hide the baseline grid and/or the document grid for clarity. (<strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Grids &amp; Guides</strong> &gt; <strong>Show Baseline Grid</strong> &amp; <strong>Hide Baseline Grid</strong>). IDML (InDesign Markup) is compatible with all Adobe InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2017. You need the Courier font installed on your machine to use this template to the fullest. You can also print the blank template when you need to draw Storyboards in clean frames on paper.</p>

<p>This template will save you time and help you design beautiful presentations.</p>
