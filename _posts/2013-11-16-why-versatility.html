<p>Versatility over specialisation: not the simplest thing to showcase &amp; promote.
People, and clients, want to talk to specialists. This is often right.</p>

<p>Yet Illustration should be more like design in its approach: in essence, it is about trying to find solutions to given problems.</p>

<p>My work takes a wide range of directions, since each style is crafted for the specific requirements of a project or brand. If you still want specialisation, keep in mind that Illustration is a just a part of visual communication. It doesnâ€™t have to be a single style, or technique. It should be what works best for the job.</p>
