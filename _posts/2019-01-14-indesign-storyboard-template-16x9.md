This is an InDesign storyboard template layout, ready to use. IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2019.

This storyboard template has 5 DIN A4 vertical (portrait) numbered pages, ready to use. All you have to do is change the **Text** and **Images** layers in InDesign to make it your own. Fill in the title page, add your credit and project details, add your logo, and so on. Write your treatment notes alongside your pictures. Your presentation is then ready to export for print or screen. The text is set in the classic screenplay form type, Courier 10 points with 12,376 points leading. For images, drop your pictures in the **Images** layer. You can show or hide the rule of thirds layer guides in locked layers to help you frame your compositions.

Duplicate the pages or spreads you want to use. Remove unnecessary sheets. Use the **Master** page to edit the footer at once.

Pictures should align to the baseline grid. The document grid modules themselves abide by the 1.77:1 ratio exactly as they should. This is very helpful to build variations on top of the initial template’s grid with ease. The smallest module is 21,333 by 12 points, its height matches the document body text’s leading.

You need the Courier font installed on your machine to use this template.

This template will help you present your storyboards quickly.
