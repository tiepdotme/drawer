<img src="/images/picture_okvhob0EUD1s6ptp7o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>Here is another template in the <a href="https://gumroad.com/Storyboards">Storyboards shop</a>. Paginated Din A4 horizontal (landscape) Storyboards template for Adobe InDesign (InDesign Markup / IDML format). 2.39:1 frame ratio â€” Scope, often used for feature films.</p>

<p>This template is ready to use for print and screen presentations. It lets you write your screenplay notes alongside your pictures; simply edit the <em>Text</em> and <em>Images</em> layers in InDesign. The text is set in 10pt Courier, the classic screenplay form typeface. For images, just drop your boards in the black <em>Images</em> layer. You can toggle on and off the rule of thirds guides in locked layers to help you frame your compositions.</p>

<p>Fill in the title page, replace the logo and credentials. To edit the footer at once, use the (GC-1) master.</p>
