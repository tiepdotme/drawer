<img src="/images/picture_ouczv9W1mR1s6ptp7o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is a free Storyboards template in PDF format on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, designed for print. This template has 5 frames per sheet each in 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen). The layout is inspired by the beautiful Storyboards from Studio Ghibli.</p>

<p>The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures for the same shot.</p>

<p>The second and main column stands for screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.</p>

<p>Then a space for your script notes: action, dialogue, etc.</p>

<p>The last column, time, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.</p>

<p>Print it out to draw on paper, the old school way (no cheating).</p>

<p>You can also get the <a href="https://gum.co/ghibli-storyboard">Japanese version of this template</a>, free as well.</p>
