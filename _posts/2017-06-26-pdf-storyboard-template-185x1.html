<img src="/images/picture_os4hpt1VjG1s6ptp7o1_r1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is a PDF Storyboards template for 1.85:1 (widescreen) aspect ratio frames, ready to print. You just need to fill it in with drawings and notes.</p>

<p>Three pages on A4 landscape; the first has 6 blank frames in two columns, three rows. The second has 3 frames in a row, facing dotted lines for text; last with dotted lines facing 3 frames in a row.</p>

<p>Each frame has a bleed dotted line surrounding its border so your drawing can exceed the border limits now and then. Great for added dynamism yet still fitting into the widescreen ratio. If you use a fine printer you&rsquo;ll be able to see rule of thirds lines in very light grey. That can be helpful to frame your compositions.</p>

<p>If you still draw your Storyboards on paper and need to work within 1.85:1 ratio, this template is for you!</p>
