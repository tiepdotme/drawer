This is a modular storyboard template layout for 2.39:1 films, that you can edit with [Adobe InDesign](https://adobe.com/products/indesign/). IDML (InDesign Markup) is compatible with all Adobe InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2019.

This template is designed to showcase storyboards for TV commercials, institutional movies and ideal for agency pitches.

This template has 9 DIN A4 horizontal (landscape) numbered pages. It gives you different layout and framing options. You can number and name your shots and write treatment notes alongside your pictures. The template includes character styles and a color scheme.

To get started, only duplicate the spreads or page you want to use. Remove unused sheets. Then all you have to do is change the **Text** and **Images** layers. Fill the opening page with your project details. The body text font is Avenir Next Regular, 9 points with 12,147 points leading. Drop your pictures into the Images layer. Show or hide the *Rule of thirds* guides to help you reframe your compositions. You will find these guides in the top locked layer.

To change or remove pagination, use any specific master that applies to your layout. Add a logo, complete the credits page and so on. Your presentation is then ready to export for print or screen.

FYI: The document grid corresponds to the 2.39:1 aspect ratio (scope). Pictures should align with the baseline grid. The document grid modules themselves abide by the 2.39:1 ratio exactly as they should. That means you can build any variation on top of the initial template’s grid with ease. Now, that is cool. Suppose you want frames in three or four rows instead of two. You can adjust all your document proportions by following the grid. JFYI, the smallest module is 29,031 by 12,147 points, its height matches the document body text’s leading.

Note that you need the Avenir Next typeface license to use this template.

This template will help you save time and design beautiful presentations.
