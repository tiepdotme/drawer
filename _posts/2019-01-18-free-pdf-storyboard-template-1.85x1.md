Here is a free PDF storyboard template for 1.85:1 aspect ratio films (widescreen), ready to print and awaiting for your drawings and notes.

This template has three DIN A4 vertical sheets. The first page has a 5 frames column facing dotted lines left blank for notes. The second page is the same except notes are first. The third page has 10 blank frames.

If you still draw on paper and need to storyboard a film in scope format, this template is for you.
