<p>If so, get these Japanese anime storyboard templates for a start.</p>

<p>These are 2 free anime Storyboards templates on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page in PDF format, ready for print. The layout has 5 frames per sheet. Each Storyboards frame sets an exact 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen) white space for pictures. This layout is drawing inspiration from the amazing Studio Ghibli Storyboards.</p>

<p>The first PDF template is a clean sheet with the frames and boxes.
The second, pictured here, has dotted lines for a production title in the header, and for numbering your pages in the footer.</p>

<p>Print it out as it is to work on paper, the old school way (no cheating).</p>

<p><strong>Boxes:</strong></p>

<p>The first column, カット indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.</p>

<p>The second and main column is 画面 which stands for screen. That’s where you draw or place your pictures.</p>

<p>内容 stands for content, use this space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)</p>

<p>The last column, 秒 is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.</p>

<p>If you like to draw your Storyboards on paper* and need to work within 1.85:1 ratio, this template will save you time and help you design beautiful anime Storyboards!</p>
