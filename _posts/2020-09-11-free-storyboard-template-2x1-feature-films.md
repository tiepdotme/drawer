Free PDF storyboard template for 2.00:1 (Univisium) aspect ratio films, ready to print, awaiting for your sequential art and notes.

This template has three DIN A4 vertical sheets. The first page has a four frames column facing dotted lines left blank for notes. The second page is the same, but with notes first. The third page has 8 blank frames.

If you still draw on paper and need to storyboard a film in scope format, this template is for you.

Print it out to draw on paper, the old school way, or import it into Adobe Photoshop, and use the template to frame your work in multiply mode and draw your storyboard on a new layer underneath it.
