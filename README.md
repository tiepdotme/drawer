# drawers
:first_quarter_moon: Repository for [@FilmStoryboards](http://twitter.com/filmStoryboards/) drawers. Originally a mirror of [@FilmStoryboards' Tumblr blog](https://film-storyboards.tumblr.com), build with Jekyll.

### Source code
This is @FilmStoryboard's [Drawers Surplus](https://film-storyboards.be "Drawers Surplus") codebase. Its main goal is to serve as a storage for some of my current and older drawings, storyboards & illustrations.

### Theme
This blog uses a slighlty modified version of [Athena](https://github.com/broccolini/athena), a simple and elegant theme for Jekyll and GitHub Pages by [Diana Mounter](http://broccolini.net). Modifications are mainly to be found in `—layouts`and `_includes` and consist in small tweaks to display images in the index and categories pages, added Gumroad integration and responsive video. No change in styling, except for smaller title size on posts to make images more prominent.
