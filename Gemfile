# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling! Keeping this uncommented for now.
# Because this repo runs on an older Jekyll version whitelisted by github-pages
gem "jekyll", "~> 3.8.7"

# This is the theme for this Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
#gem "jekyll-athena"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
#gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-feed'
  gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
  gem 'github-pages'
